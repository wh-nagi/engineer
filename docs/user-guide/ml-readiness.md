# ML-Readiness: Feature Normalization

This guide explains the `normalized` field in feature metadata and how to prepare features for machine learning models.

[Price and Volume Feature Families](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/machine-learning-for-trading/blob/d2edec54b1c7a6a9d7a97d8129eb05db4491e1eb/08_financial_features/01_price_volume_features.ipynb) calls Engineer's registry and selected feature functions, then combines them with manual teaching implementations. The [Book Guide](../book-guide/index.md) records the pinned revision and relationship.

Use this page when you need to decide which features can go straight into a model and
which ones should pass through a preprocessing step first.

## Overview

Features in ml4t-engineer have a `normalized` metadata field that indicates whether a feature produces bounded outputs suitable for direct ML consumption:

- **`normalized=True`** (37 features): Output is bounded (typically 0-100 or -1 to 1). ML-ready without preprocessing.
- **`normalized=False`** (83 features): Output is unbounded (raw prices, volumes, spreads). Requires preprocessing.

## Why Normalization Matters

Machine learning models (especially neural networks and distance-based methods) perform better when features are on similar scales:

- **Gradient descent** converges faster with normalized inputs
- **Distance metrics** (k-NN, SVM) are biased toward high-magnitude features
- **Regularization** works correctly only when features have similar scales

## Normalized Features (ML-Ready)

These 37 features produce bounded outputs and can be used directly in ML models:

## Using the Registry API

<!-- ml4t-exec -->
```python
from ml4t.engineer.core.registry import get_registry

registry = get_registry()

# List all normalized features
normalized_features = [
    name for name in registry.list_all()
    if registry.get(name).normalized is True
]

# Check if a specific feature is normalized
meta = registry.get("rsi")
print(f"RSI normalized: {meta.normalized}")  # True

# Get features by category that are normalized
momentum_normalized = [
    name for name in registry.list_by_category("momentum")
    if registry.get(name).normalized is True
]

assert "rsi" in normalized_features
assert "rsi" in momentum_normalized
```

## Preprocessing Non-Normalized Features

For features with `normalized=False`, use the preprocessing module:

```python
from ml4t.engineer.preprocessing import StandardScaler, RobustScaler

# Standard scaling (mean=0, std=1)
scaler = StandardScaler()
features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(features_df)

# Robust scaling (resistant to outliers)
scaler = RobustScaler()
features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(features_df)
```

### When to Use Each Scaler

| Scaler | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| `StandardScaler` | Data is approximately Gaussian |
| `RobustScaler` | Data has outliers or fat tails |
| `MinMaxScaler` | Need bounded 0-1 range |

## Best Practices

1. **Don't double-normalize**: If using normalized features (RSI, Stochastic), don't apply additional scaling.

2. **Consistent preprocessing**: Use `fit()` on training data, `transform()` on test data to prevent leakage.

3. **Group similar features**: When mixing normalized and non-normalized features, scale only the non-normalized ones.

4. **Consider feature ranges**: Even normalized features may have different effective ranges (RSI rarely hits 0 or 100 in practice).

## Example: Mixed Feature Pipeline

```python
from ml4t.engineer import compute_features
from ml4t.engineer.core.registry import get_registry
from ml4t.engineer.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Compute mixed features
result = compute_features(ohlcv, ["rsi", "sma", "atr", "macd"])

# Separate normalized and non-normalized
registry = get_registry()
normalized_cols = [
    col for col in result.columns
    if any(registry.get(f).normalized for f in ["rsi"]
           if col.startswith(f))
]
non_normalized_cols = [col for col in result.columns if col not in normalized_cols]

# Scale only non-normalized features
scaler = StandardScaler()
result = result.with_columns(
    scaler.fit_transform(result.select(non_normalized_cols))
)
```
